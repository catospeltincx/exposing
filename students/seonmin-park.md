"Welcome. Bite, chew, taste and digest the unordered/misordered menu."

There are many discourses over racial issues these days but Asians have always been marginalized in the topic. The way the West illustrates the East has not been changed for centuries. It is not even problematic. It is just regarded  as "cliche". My project talks about orientalism including objectification.
