  “He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster.
  And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.” 

  ― Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil

Combining both philosophical reflections on dualism and religious retrospection based on guilt, I created Leïla El Jamil.
Giving life to a character, to a second self, is a way to experience everything that I cannot live and express on my behalf.
The disguise becomes the way of escape towards a parallel universe and consequently, a questioning of my human condition as a deep reality.

Short Cuts is an installation of Leila's environment, composed of a bed, some polaroids and an old VHS camera in which the videos can be played.
